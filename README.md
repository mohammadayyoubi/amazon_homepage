### Key Responsive Features:
1. Navbar adapts to smaller screens like tablets.
2. Product boxes adjust their size and alignment.
3. Footer reorganizes to display fewer columns on narrow screens.
   - At **480px**, two `<ul>` elements are displayed per row.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser (use live server when run).
3. Interact with the page to explore its functionality.
